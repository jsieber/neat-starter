## Ingredients

* 3 tablespoons butter, melted
* 8 burrito flour tortilla shells
* 4 cups rotisserie chicken, shredded
* 4 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
* 1 teaspoon chili powder
* 1 teaspoon minced garlic or garlic powder
* 1/2 teaspoon onion salt
* 1 4-ounce can diced green chiles, drained
* 1 15.5-ounce can of hominy or corn, drained
* 1 7.75-ounce can of El Pato Hot Tomato Sauce

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 425Â°.
2. The Chicken Quesadilla Bake is cooked between two full size (18"x26") baking sheets. Use one half of the melted butter to coat the bottom of one baking sheet.
3. Place two of the tortilla shells on each long edge so that half of the tortilla shells are hanging over the edge. Place a tortilla shell in the same fashion over each short edge of the baking pan. Finally, place one tortilla shell in the center of the baking sheet so that the entire bottom of the baking sheet is covered.
